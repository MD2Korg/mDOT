						<h2>Technology Research & Development Project 2 (TR&D2): Optimization</h2>
						 <p>Dynamic Optimization of Continuously Adapting mHealth Interventions via Prudent, Statistically Efficient, and Coherent Reinforcement Learning</p>

							<p>Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have typically used hand-crafted decision rules that map from biomarkers of an individual’s state to the selection of interventions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for online optimization of decision rules. Continuous, passive detection of the individual’s state using mHealth biomarkers enables dynamic deployment of decision rules at the right moment, i.e., as and when events of interest are detected from sensors. RL-based optimization methods that leverage this new capability created by sensor-based biomarkers, can enable the development and optimization of temporally-precise mHealth interventions, overcoming the significant limitations of static, one-size-fits-all decision rules. Such next generation interventions have the potential to lead to greater treatment efficacy and improved long-term engagement.</p>
							<p>However, there exist several critical challenges to the realization of effective, real-world RL-based interventions including the need to learn efficiently based on limited interactions with an individual while accounting for longer-term effects of intervention decisions, (i.e., to avoid habituation and ensure continued engagement), and accommodating multiple intervention components operating at different time scales and targeting different outcomes. As a result, the use of RL in mHealth interventions has mostly been limited to very few studies using basic RL methods.</p>
							<p>To address these critical challenges, TR&D2 builds on more precise biomarkers of context, including TR&D1 risk and engagement scores, to develop, evaluate, and disseminate robust and data efficient RL methods and tools. These methods continually personalize the selection, adaptation and delivery timing decision rules for core intervention components so as to maximize long-term therapeutic efficacy and engagement for every individual.</p>
							<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Innovation</h3>
								<p>TR&D2 enables a broad segment of the mHealth research community to use online RL algorithms for personalizing mHealth interventions so as to maximize intervention effects and engagement. This project is innovative because the developed personalization algorithms will use models that are interpretable by mHealth intervention scientists. This, along with our track record of strong collaborations with mHealth scientists, will lead to a transformation in the role intervention scientists play in designing and evaluating these algorithms. Few have successfully deployed RL in the mHealth context as this requires new RL algorithms that meet all 5 challenges listed above. At this time, such algorithms do not exist. This project tackles these challenges in a novel manner, combining ideas from computer science, behavioral science and statistics.</p>
