							<p>The past decade has seen tremendous advances in the ability to compute a diverse array of mobile sensor-based biomarkers in order to passively estimate health states, activities, and associated contexts (e.g. physical activity, sleep, smoking, mood, craving, stress, and geospatial context). Researchers are now engaged in the conduct of both observational and interventional field studies of increasing complexity and length that leverage mHealth sensor and biomarker technologies combined with the collection of measures of disease progression and other outcomes. As a result of the expansion of the set of available mHealth biomarkers and the push toward long-term, real-world deployment of mHealth technologies, a new set of critical gaps has emerged that were previously obscured by the focus of the field on smaller-scale proof-of-concept studies and the investigation of single biomarkers in isolation.</p>
							<p>First, the issue of missing sensor and biomarker data in mHealth field studies has quickly become a critical problem that directly and significantly impacts many of our CPs. Issues including intermittent wireless dropouts, wearables and smartphones running out of battery power, participants forgetting to carry or wear devices, and participants exercising privacy controls can all contribute to complex patterns of missing data that significantly complicate data analysis and limit the effectiveness of sensor-informed mHealth interventions. Second, with increasing interest in the use of reinforcement learning methods to provide online adaptation of interventions for every individual, there is an urgent need for high-quality, compact and interpretable feature representations that can enable more effective learning under strict budgets on the number of interactions with patients. Finally, as in other areas that are leveraging machine learning methods to drive scientific discovery and support decision making, mHealth needs methods that can be used to derive high-level knowledge and support causal hypothesis generation based on complex, non-linear models fit to biomarker time series data.</p>
							<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Innovation</h3>
								<p>TR&amp;D1 works to perform the following innovative research activities in order to address the four main challenges for temporally-precise medicine:</p>
								<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull; Develop state-of-the art deep probabilistic neural network models for efficiently and accurately imputing missing data and propagating uncertainty in hierarchical multi-timescale biomarker computation graphs.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Develop methods for compressing multiple biomarkers that serve as risk factors into personalized composite risk scores using novel recurrent neural network models that correctly account for biomarker uncertainty.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Develop methods and tools for introspecting the time-varying and contextual relationships between risk factors and risk scores learned by complex, non-linear risk scoring models to support knowledge discovery and intervention design in the face of uncertainty in underlying risk factors.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Develop a full-stack analytics codebase for biomarker uncertainty modeling, risk modeling, and model introspection and analysis that will interoperate between the edge, cloud, and stand-alone use cases needed to fully-support mHealth research.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Develop and disseminate reference imputation models for widely used sensor data modalities including IMU, PPG, RIP, GPS, and key biomarkers including stress, steps, and cigarette smoking; as well as reference risk score models for a range of adverse events including smoking lapse, sedentary behavior, alert fatigue and intervention disengagement.</p>
							<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Technological Impact</h3>
								<p>TR&amp;D1's technologies have a significant potential to advance the fundamental understanding of health and behavior by supporting the analysis of complex, longitudinal, mHealth data. Improvements in modeling and propagating uncertainty due to missing data will lead to enhanced longitudinal coverage of computed biomarker values in addition to well-calibrated uncertainty in biomarker values. Research on data-efficient personalization of dynamic risk scores will lead to novel ideographic insights about the temporal relationships between context, risk factors, intervention receptivity and engagement, and health outcomes. Methods for analyzing temporal dynamics of risk will be used to identify the most opportune timing for delivering interventions, while the identification of the most salient risk factors that drive adverse outcomes at the current moment can be used to optimize the intervention content. By identifying the modifiable risk factors whose change is likely to have the greatest impact on the risk of adverse outcomes at specific times, interventions can be designed with maximum temporal precision and efficacy. By enabling the delivery of interventions in the face of data loss and uncertainty due to a wide range of adverse real-world conditions, TR&amp;D1 will improve the overall robustness of mHealth interventions in real-world deployments, leading directly to improved health outcomes.</p>
