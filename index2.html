										<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
										<p>The mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation of Temporally-Precise Interventions (the mDOT Center) provides the methods, tools, and infrastructure for researchers to discover, optimize and deploy temporally-precise mHealth interventions to address growing public health problems.</p>
										<p>Organized around three <a href="trdhome.html">Technology Research & Development</a> (TR&D) projects, mDOT represents a unique national resource that is developing multiple methodological and technological innovations. Each TR&D is creating technological resources for the biological community that include easily deployable wearables, apps for wearables and smartphones, and a companion mHealth cloud system, all of which are open-source.</p>

											<h3>HEALTH NEEDS</h3>
											<p>One of the biggest drivers of the nationâ€™s rising healthcare spending is providing care for patients with chronic diseases, many of which are linked to health behaviors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking.  A key strategy for making self-care and preventive measures more achievable has been the integration of passive monitoring into everyday life via mobile sensors and providing personalized information and guidance to patients. </p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<span class="icon major fa-code style3"></span>
											<h3>mHEALTH SOLUTIONS</h3>
											<p>The tools developed by mDOT transform the ability of researchers to leverage the full range of available sensors and mobile technologies, allowing them to deliver dynamically personalized and temporally-precise mHealth interventions to individuals. These interventions can precipitate a much-needed transformation by enabling patients to initiate and sustain the lifestyle choices necessary to prevent or successfully manage the burden of chronic health conditions.</p>

											</header>
											<p>mDOT resources make remote care possible for patients via mHealth interventions who have traditionally required close involvement of clinicians, marking a major transformation in the care delivery. Our deliverables enable much greater personalization of such interventions by expanding access to many new and emerging biomarkers.</p>

												<p>To ensure these innovations have a broad impact and solve real-world problems, mDOT works with a number of collaborative projects to engage in joint-effort technology developments, each of which make a unique contribution, as well as selected service projects to provide opportunities to a wide variety of research teams who are well-equipped to become early adopters of mDOT technologies which meet their research needs.</p>

													<h3><p><a href="cps.html">COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS</a></h3>
													<p>mDOT teams with seven collaborative projects (CPs), each of which make a unique contribution from their respective sites across the country. These collaborations encompass several health targets including addictive behavior, sedentary behavior, cardiovascular diseases, oral health, and mental health. Our CPs cover analysis of data from observational studies, theory development, intervention design, development, testing, and novel sensor and biomarker development.</p>

													<h3><a href="sps.html">SERVICE PROJECTS</a></h3>
													<p>mDOT has assembled a unique set of service projects (SPs). As the goal of mDOT is to create new mHealth technological assets in the research community, successful transition to a diverse group of service projects, whose needs are being served by mDOT technologies, is essential to test and enhance the research utility of mDOT. These SPs are well-equipped to test and deploy mDOT technologies as soon as they become available. </p>
