							<p>Vigorous research activity in mHealth has resulted in an ever-growing list of physiological and behavioral markers. However, translation of these biomarkers into real time intervention lagged behind the observational research studies that led to their development due to computation, storage, and communication bottlenecks faced by wearables and smartphone platforms. Further, the next generation of wearables is emerging with the ability to sample data from multiple sensors at rates several orders of magnitude higher than current-generation devices, exacerbating the computational and communication bottleneck. They can image structure, motion, and function, to provide visibility into physiology previously possible only in clinics.</p>
							<p>Traditionally, such imaging sensors use post-processing algorithms for feature identification, co-registration, alignment and enhancement. However, high frequency-high volume imaging data from wearables cannot be transported to cloud computing for post-processing. Finally, researchers have shown that the high-dimensionality sensor data needed to compute biomarkers present immense privacy risks. Advances in machine learning are leading to an ever-growing list of surprising inferences about user identity and activities that can be made from seemingly innocuous sensors, particularly when data are captured over long durations. Simplistic methods such as stripping personally identifiable information and addition of noise that focus on anonymizing the data have been ineffective for mHealth, both from privacy and utility perspectives, particularly with the availability of vast amounts of side information (e.g. metadata), computational power, and advanced algorithms.</p>
							<p>To address these growing challenges, we propose a hierarchical computing framework that reduces the data into minimal modular abstractions called Micromarkers computed at the edge devices. Micromarkers can be used directly as features in new biomarker inferences or can be adapted to support legacy algorithms. TR&D3 is developing hardware, software, and computational techniques to implement privacy-aware, efficient, and embedded intelligence support into wearables. They will enable continuous, high-throughput, low latency biomarker captures across wearable, mobile, and cloud platforms to support large scale and long-term research studies, and eventual real-life rollout.</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Research Goals</h3>
								<p>TR&D3 is conducting the following innovative research to address the technological challenges described above:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<li>Develop modular and reusable micromarker abstractions to enable resource-efficient concurrent computation of a growing collection of biomarkers.</li>
										<li>Create signal processing architectures combining Compressive Sensing and Machine Learning algorithms to support biomarker computations on resource constrained high data rate sensor arrays.</li>
										<li>Enable optimization of privacy-utility tradeoffs in biomarker computations via cross-layer mechanism design.</li>
									</ul>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Technological Resources</h3>
								<p>TR&D3 is producing the following technological resources for the community:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<li>mDOT applications and software development kits (SDKs) on popular wearables, personal devices, and smartphones with embedded micromarker-based implementation of biomarkers for stress, fatigue, speaking, smoking, craving, eating, brushing, and new biomarkers from <a href="cps.html">collaborative projects</a></li>
										<li>Reference design and prototypes of mDOT radio-frequency (RF) Patch sensors, modular hardware modules and embedded software cores to power wearable sensor arrays</li>
										<li>A toolbox for exploring privacy implications of sensor and biomarker choices and enabling run-time control over privacy-utility trade-off in biomarker implementations.</li>
									</ul>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Impact on Science & Society</h3>
								<p>TR&D3 will make it possible for temporally-precise mHealth interventions for maintaining health and managing the growing burden of chronic diseases, to be realized on participantsâ€™ personal devices with minimal impact on battery life so as not to interfere with routine usage of these devices. TR&D3 will also enable much greater personalization of such interventions by expanding access to many new and emerging biomarkers, resulting in a higher likelihood of continued engagement and improved efficacy. By enabling the computation of novel biomarkers from the next generation of high data rate sensors that provide unprecedented visibility into physiology, previously possible only in clinical settings, TR&D3 will enable remote care for patients via mHealth interventions who have traditionally required close involvement of clinicians, marking a major transformation in the care delivery, especially to the neediest. By providing fine-grained and low-burden privacy control to patients over their data being shared with third parties, TR&D3 will ensure that the health impact of temporally-precise mHealth interventions is not adversely impacted by privacy concerns.</p>
